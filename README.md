## LibDriver SYN6288

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/syn6288/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

SYN6288 Chinese speech synthesis chip is a middle and high-end speech synthesis chip with higher cost performance and more natural effect launched by Beijing Yuyintianxia Technology Co., Ltd. in early 2010. SYN6288 receives the text to be synthesized through the asynchronous serial port to realize the text to sound (TTS) conversion. The latest SYN6288 speech synthesis chip inherits the excellent features of OSYNO6188 : the smallest SSOP28L chip package, simple hardware interface and high cost performance; In addition, SYN6288 text recognition is more intelligent, speech synthesis is more natural, and speech synthesis effect and intelligent recognition effect are greatly improved. It is a speech synthesis chip for high-end applications.

LibDriver SYN6288 is a full-featured driver for SYN6288, launched by LibDriver.It provides text synthesis, music synthesis, alarm sound synthesis and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SYN6288 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SYN6288 UART platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SYN6288 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SYN6288 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SYN6288 offline document.

/datasheet includes SYN6288 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface UART platform independent template and finish your platform UART driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_syn6288_basic.h"

uint8_t res;

res = syn6288_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

res = syn6288_basic_synthesis("你好");
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)syn6288_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}
(void)syn6288_basic_sync();

...

(void)syn6288_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example advance

```C
#include "driver_syn6288_advance.h"

uint8_t res;

res = syn6288_advance_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

res = syn6288_advance_synthesis("你好");
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)syn6288_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
(void)syn6288_advance_sync();

...

res = syn6288_advance_sound(SYN6288_SOUND_A);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)syn6288_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
(void)syn6288_advance_sync()    

...
    
res = syn6288_advance_message(SYN6288_MESSAGE_A);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)syn6288_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
(void)syn6288_advance_sync();

...

res = syn6288_advance_ring(SYN6288_RING_A);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)syn6288_advance_deinit();

    return 1;
}
(void)syn6288_advance_sync();

...
    
(void)syn6288_advance_deinit();

return 0;
```
